Beans
-> Simple java Objects , managed by Spring Container



How can we create beans?

     i)by XML configuration (not recommended in SpringBoot)
     ii)by using stereo type  annotation (@Component, @Controller, @RestController, @Service,@Repository)
     iii)by using @Bean annotation ,inside a configuration file(the class which contaion @configuration)


What is  @SpringBootApplication annotation?
i)->it specifies the entry point for the our SpringBoot project
  ->it is the combination of 3 annotation
		i)@SpringBootConfiguration->it gives the ability to create beans by @Bean inside the root file of the project
		ii)@EnableAutoConfiguration->by this annotation spring container reads the dependencies,download the jar files & register them inside envi
